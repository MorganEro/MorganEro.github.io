        time: 2014 - 2021
        company: Orange Theory Fitness
        details: |
          I was hired because the owner loved how I coached her daughters in Gymnastics. I had no work experience as a coach at this time.
          After 3 years of working for the company, I was promoted to head trainer and asked to work at 3 of her other locations. I learned 
          a lot about managing people and my time while with this company.
            - Coached Group Fitness classes of up to 34 Attendants
            - Collaborated with Clients and Staff to reach common goals
